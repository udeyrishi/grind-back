# Grind Web Service

Grind is a web application for reading news, articles, and blog posts that adds a new dimension to the act of reading. Grind gathers articles from multiple online sources, and uses Natural Language Processing to understand the sentiment the author tried to put into the piece of writing. It also discovers keywords associated with the text, so as to give a quick summary to the reader. All this information is provided to the user in a very modern and delightful way that allows them to either skim through the articles, or open them to read further. This repository contains the cloud service that powers Grind.

* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
* [Indico](https://indico.io/)
* [WebHose](https://webhose.io/)

### Installation

For running the Azure Cloud Service locally, ideally you would need a Windows machine; though you might be able to use [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com/) to get it working on OS X as well. You should be able to open the supporting C# libraries in Xamarin out of the box, though the Azure Cloud Service itself might require some work.

On a Windows machine:

- Download and install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs)
- Install the [Azure SDK](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)

This project was built for Hack the North, Waterloo - 2015
